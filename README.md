# GEOG5990M project final assignmnt

# Project Background
This project focuses on the spatial distribution of e-commerce access in Leeds, United Kingdom. In todayâ€™s digital age, understanding the disparities in access to e-commerce can provide valuable insights for policy-makers, businesses, and community leaders. The analysis aims to identify areas with varying levels of e-commerce access and understand how these levels correlate with different demographic and socio-economic groups classified by output areas.

# Project Objectives

Merge multiple datasets including demographic data, socioeconomic indexes, and geographical data pertaining to Leeds.

Analyze the e-commerce access across different output areas classified within the city.

Visualize the results using both statistical graphs and geographical mapping to provide a comprehensive view of the data.

# How the Code Works
1. Data Loading and Preparation:

   NSP21CL_NOV23_UK_LU_1.csv: National statistics postcodes data.

   ppfi_index_v2_nov2023.csv: Postcode level Future Internet Index data.

   oac21ew.csv: Output Area Classification data.

   classification_codes_and_names.csv: Descriptive names for each classification code.

   A shapefile containing the geographical boundaries of Leeds.

3. Data Filtering:
The data from NSP21CL_NOV23_UK_LU_1.csv is filtered to only include entries from Leeds using the 'ladnm' field.

4. Data Merging:
The datasets are merged based on geographic codes to associate internet access indexes with output area classifications and geographic boundaries.

5. Data Analysis:
The merged data is then used to compute the distribution of e-commerce access index across various demographic groups within Leeds.

7. Visualization:
A bar plot is generated to visually represent e-commerce access by different output area classifications.
A geographical map is produced to show the spatial distribution of e-commerce access in Leeds. The map uses a 'coolwarm' color scheme to depict varying levels of access, with the color intensity representing the priority of access from highest to lowest.

8. Visualization Outcomes:

    Bar Chart: Demonstrates the e-commerce access index for different classifications, highlighting significant disparities between areas.
   
    Geographical Map: Provides a spatial representation of e-commerce access, showing how access is distributed across Leeds. The color-coded map helps identify high-priority and low-priority areas in terms of e-commerce access.
